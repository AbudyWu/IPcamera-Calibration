###Introduction
By capturing images of the chessboard, we obtain the camera's intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. After converting the three points on the chessboard, (0, 0), (1, 0), and (0, 1), to 3D coordinates, they should approximately match the size of the chessboard squares.(The image below shows the actual test results)
